// Holo motion engine — ported from arlan.me/vault/holo (engine.ts).
// See /reference/holo-vault for the original source and provenance notes.
//
// This file is the REUSABLE part: the tilt/foil/glare math and the classes
// that drive it (Follow, Kick, Orientation). It has no knowledge of what
// card content it's painted onto — that lives in the data array and in
// HoloCard.jsx.
//
// Ported as plain JS (dropping TS interfaces) to match this project's
// existing scaffold. `mediaUrl()` and the hardcoded photo/print/tile
// constants from the source were removed — those are now parameters
// (`applyFoil` takes a photoUrl and tile colors) since every card has its
// own photo, and this project's print colors differ from Arlan's pink.

/* ── Tiles ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Inline SVG rather than files: small, no extra requests, cannot 404.
